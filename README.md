# UCB-CS61C

This repo houses my self-study material for UCB course: **CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture**. I am doing the *Fall 2020* version to be coherent with the available material

## Course Description

This is the last course in Berkeley's CS61 series, which dives into the internal of computer architecture and will make you understand how the C language is translated into RISC-V assembly language and executed on the CPU.

More on the course, resources and recordings can be found in [csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki/en/%E4%BD%93%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84/CS61C/)

## Why learning Computer Architecture?

I will just put this quote by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/about/) as the main drive for learning:
> I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (the browser, the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you're running on top of) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard problems.
